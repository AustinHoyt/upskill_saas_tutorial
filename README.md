[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App

This project is what introduced me to using Ruby on Rails, using GitHub, and how 
to add features like e-commerce, contact mailers, and a few others.

This was my first time dealing with a majority so I stuck close to the code
that was given, but I learned a lot and created a sample site with what
I learned. This was a great stepping stone! 

Any tips on how to make it better would be greatly appreciated.
